## About
For this project, we created a mental health application with React. This is an application was created using MERN stack. It allows users to choose their method of de-stressing with meditation, yoga, stretching, or running. The main motivation for this project is to create an application that will allow users to manage their stress through an interactive experience and eventually have the ability to save videos to their favorites given future development.
